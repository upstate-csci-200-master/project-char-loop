Write a program that reads in a string from standard input and determines the following:
```
how many vowels are in the string
how many upper case characters are in the string
how many digits are in the string
how many white space characters are in the string
```

example input

```
This String has vowels and 12345 digits. 
```

example output
```
vowels = 8
upper = 2
digits = 5
whitespace = 6
```

For a grade of B, modify the C program to indicate which vowel occurs the most. In the case of a tie, only output the vowel which comes first alphabetically.

example input
```
This String has vowels and 12345 digits. 
```

example output
```
vowels = 8
upper = 2
digits = 5
whitespace = 6
vowel i occurs the most = 4
```

For a grade of A, modify the B program to output a list of all repeated characters.
