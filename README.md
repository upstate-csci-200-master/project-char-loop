Write a program (C version) that reads in a string from standard input and determines the following:
```
how many vowels are in the string (FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM 'Y' is NOT considered a vowel)
how many upper case characters are in the string
how many digits are in the string
how many white space characters are in the string
```

example input

```
This String has vowels and 12345 digits. 
```

example output
```
vowels = 8
upper = 2
digits = 5
whitespace = 6
```

For a grade of B, modify the C program to indicate which vowel occurs the most. In the case of a tie, only output the vowel which comes first alphabetically.

example input
```
This String has vowels and 12345 digits. 
```

example output
```
vowels = 8
upper = 2
digits = 5
whitespace = 6
vowel i occurs the most = 4
```

For a grade of A, modify the B program to output a list of all consecutively repeated characters. That is any character which repeats consecutively in the string. 

example input
```
Some people raise raccoons for their pelts. A raccoon's home is called a nook. The person who cleans and tidies up the raccoonnooks is called the raccoonnookkeeper. Real word! 
```

example output
```
vowels = 59
upper = 4
digits = 0
whitespace = 28
vowel o occurs the most = 21
repeated characters: c o c o l o c o n o l c o n o k e
```
